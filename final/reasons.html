				<h1>Why are meta tags important?</h1>
					<img class="flow-left circle content-image img-padding-right" src="https://openclipart.org/image/800px/226080" alt="The word SEO in the center with SEO terms surrounding it.">
					<p>Think of meta tags as a chance to make a good first impression. When users see your page on search results, you’re trying to convince them to click on your page to explore more about what you have to offer.</p>
					<p>That means you want to provide them with the primary pieces of information that make them want to click on your page. This includes the title of your page, description, and making sure your meta tags are high-quality. If your meta description is bad, unclear, or outdated, no one will want to click on it.</p>
					<p>When having good writing along with a good meta configuration, it’ll help search engine robots have a better understanding of the content of each of our web pages and can better recommend your pages to your target audience.</p>
					<p>The more the robots understand, the more likely a website can rank higher in the search engine results pages (SERPs for short). Because meta tags impact your website’s ranking in search engine results, they can also affect your traffic and engagement rates.</p>
					<p>By having good meta tags, you can achieve more clicks and offer your users a better experience within your website. Therefore, they make a critical impact on how solid your SEO strategy is and how many people you can reel toward your pages.</p>
