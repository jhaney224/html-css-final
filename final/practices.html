				<h1>Best Practices</h1>
					<p>There are important tips that should be considered for enhanced SEO.</p>

					<h2>Title Tag</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Keep your titles at 60 characters or less to ensure they don’t appear clipped by search engines.</li>
						<li>Keep one title tag per page and place it in the &lt;head&gt; section to make sure search engines know which page they should rank. Be sure to also ensure they are unique to each page and differ from your competitors.</li>
						<li>Have a clean title for a professional look (eg. capitalizing the first letter in your title and proofreading it for spelling and grammar).</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Meta Descriptions</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The ideal length for a meta description is 120-158 characters (enough for mobile devices to see it but not too long for Google to display).</li>
						<li>Sometimes less is more. Getting right to the point, with the most targeted and important information within the first 120 characters can increase your CTR (click-through rate).</li>
						<li>Keep your meta descriptions catchy, inviting, descriptive, and thoughtful while still being concise.</li>
						<li>Include your keyword where it makes sense. The best keyword to use is a word or phrase searched frequently by your target audience, is relevant to your page, and is already within your site’s ranking power.</li>
						<li>Have unique meta descriptions for each page on your site. By doing this, your page can cast a wider net and incorporate various targeted keywords to drive more users.</li>
					</ul>
